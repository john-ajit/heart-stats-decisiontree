# heart-stats-decisiontree

In this project, decision trees were utilized to predict the presence of heart disease based on various medical attributes from the UC Irvine dataset. Decision trees, a type of supervised learning algorithm, were chosen for their simplicity and interpretability. The process began by splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets. The decision tree algorithm was then trained on the training data, where it recursively partitioned the data into subsets based on the most significant features that maximized the separation of heart disease presence and absence.
